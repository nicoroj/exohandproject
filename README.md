# About Exo-Hand Project

This project is focused on developing a low-cost rehabilitation exoskeleton hand to help stroke survivors improve the function of their hands. The goal is to design this exoskeleton with different modes that will help stroke survivors regain strength, mobility, and control in their hands, which can be a key factor in their overall recovery and ability to perform everyday tasks. . Ultimately, the goal is to help stroke survivors achieve greater independence and improve their quality of life through rehabilitation of their hands.


As someone who is dedicated to helping stroke survivors rehabilitate their hands, I am well aware of the challenges that come with developing a technology project in a resource-limited setting like my home country, Colombia. Access to healthcare and technology is somewhat limited, making it difficult to acquire the materials and equipment necessary for this project but, also difficult for stroke survivors to obtain affordable resources to improve their lives. However, I am determined to bring the exoskeleton hand project to as many stroke survivors as possible, despite these obstacles. My goal is to make this project a reality and keep it as easy and affordable as possible. With your support, we can work together to overcome these challenges and make a meaningful impact on the lives of stroke survivors. Thank you for considering supporting my efforts.
