# About Exo-Hand Project

This project is focused on developing a low-cost rehabilitation exoskeleton hand to help stroke survivors improve the function of their hands, achieve greater independence and improve their life quality through rehabilitation of their hands.

I am aware of the challenges that come with developing a technological project in a resource-limited setting like my home country of Colombia, where access to healthcare and technology can be limited and it can be difficult for stroke survivors to afford resources to improve their lives. That is why I am determined to bring this project to as many stroke survivors as possible.

My plan is to make the exoskeleton as accessible and affordable as possible, so that anyone can build it. With your support, we can overcome these challenges and make a meaningful difference in the lives of stroke survivors. Thank you for considering supporting my efforts.

# How does the exoskeleton work?

The exoskeleton will move the fingers of stroke survivors using three modes which will be described below. Look at this video and my youtube channel to understand more about the project. (Low qualitiy video)

### CPM Mode: 
One of the modes is a continuous-passive movement in which the exoskeleton repeatedly flexes and extends the person's hand fingers.

### Manual Mode: 
The second mode moves the person's finger using a potentiometer. Therefore, depending on the position of the potentiometer, it will move the fingers of the hand.

### FSR Mode: (still in development) 
Using a force sensor placed at the tip of the person's index finger, the fingers move depending on the force exerted by the patient on this force sensor.
