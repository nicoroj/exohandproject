# About Exo-Hand Project

This project is focused on developing a low-cost rehabilitation exoskeleton hand to help stroke survivors improve the function of their hands. The goal is to design this exoskeleton with different modes that will help stroke survivors regain strength, mobility, and control in their hands, which can be a key factor in their overall recovery and ability to perform everyday tasks. . Ultimately, the goal is to help stroke survivors achieve greater independence and improve their quality of life through rehabilitation of their hands.


I am well aware of the challenges that come with developing a technology project in a resource-limited setting like my home country, Colombia. Access to healthcare and technology is somewhat limited, making it difficult to acquire the materials and equipment necessary for this project but, also difficult for stroke survivors to obtain affordable resources to improve their lives. However, I am determined to bring the exoskeleton hand project to as many stroke survivors as possible, despite these obstacles. My goal is to make this project a reality and keep it as easy and affordable as possible. With your support, we can work together to overcome these challenges and make a meaningful impact on the lives of stroke survivors. Thank you for considering supporting my efforts.

The main purpose of this exoskeleton is to provide stroke survivors with continuous passive motion therapy to improve the function of their hand. By using this technology, we hope to increase their independence and enhance their quality of life through rehabilitation.

My goal is to make the exoskeleton as accessible and affordable as possible, so that anyone can build it. With your support, we can overcome these challenges and make a meaningful difference in the lives of stroke survivors. Thank you for considering supporting my efforts.

# How does it work?

### CPM Mode: 
One of the modes is a continuous-passive movement in which the exoskeleton repeatedly flexes and extends the patient's hand fingers.
### Manual Mode: 
The second mode moves the patient's hand with a potentiometer. Therefore, depending on the position of the potentiometer, it will move the fingers of the hand.
### FSR Mode: 
Using a force sensor placed at the tip of the patient's index finger, the fingers move depending on the force exerted by the patient on this force sensor.
